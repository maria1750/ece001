 <h1> Characteristics Of Big Data </h1>
 <h2>Big data can be described by the following characteristics:</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Volume</li>
    <li>Variety</li>
    <li>Velocity</li>
    <li>Variability</li>
 </ul>


  <h3>
  (i) Volume – The name Big Data itself is related to a size which is enormous.
  Size of data plays a very crucial role in determining value out of data.
  Also, whether a particular data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not,
  is dependent upon the volume of data. Hence, 
  'Volume' is one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with Big Data.

  (ii) Variety – The next aspect of Big Data is its variety.
   Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data both structured and unstructured.
   During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most of the applications.  
   Nowadays, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, audio, etc.
   are also being considered in the analysis applications.
   This variety of unstructured data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analyzing data.
    
  (iii) Velocity – The term 'velocity' refers to the speed of generation of data. 
  How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data.
  Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes,
  application logs, networks, and social media sites, sensors, Mobile devices, etc.
  The flow of data is massive and continuous.

  (iv) Variability – This refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times,
   thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.

  <h2>Benefits of Big Data Processing</h2>
  <h3>Ability to process Big Data brings in multiple benefits, such as-
   Businesses can utilize outside intelligence while taking decisions
   Access to social data from search engines and sites like facebook,
   twitter are enabling organizations to fine tune their business strategies.
   Improved customer service
   Traditional customer feedback systems are getting replaced by new systems designed with Big Data technologies.
   In these new systems, Big Data and natural language processing technologies are being used to read and evaluate
   consumer responses.
   Early identification of risk to the product/services, if any Better operational efficiency
   Big Data technologies can be used for creating a staging area or landing zone for new data before 
   identifying what data should be moved to the data warehouse.  
   In addition, such integration of Big Data technologies and data warehouse helps an organization  
   to offload infrequently accessed data.
